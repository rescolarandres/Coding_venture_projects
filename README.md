# Coding Venture Projects
![My profile in the webpage where I ad myself](https://github.com/rescolarandres/Coding_venture_projects/blob/main/clases.png "Image Title")
Let me tell you about my side projects!.
During the pandemic I was super bored at home and I was beginning to play a little bit with coding, so I decided to open an online academy to help solve college students their projects and thesis. Soon, I started making money with it, and by today I have done more than 100 projects, some of them quite complex and what I like the most is that they are super different fields, such as bio medics, mathematical algorithms, GPS's...

Thanks to this side project I have been able to learn coding quite a lot by myself, and specially, what I think I have become really good at, is taking requisites from the clients. Since each project is very different from others I have to be very concise with what the client expects from my code to give him the best solution possible. Now I know what questions to ask, and challenge them too to see which way of doing things would fit them more.
