# Coding Venture Projects
In here, some of the projects I have developed as freelance coder are shared. Most of them are related to Master's/Bachelor Thesis/Assigments in which I helped students solve their codes. This type of projects help me learn and implement coding solutions to an broad range of fields, varying from telco engineering to power forecasting models.
