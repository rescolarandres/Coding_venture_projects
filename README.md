# Coding Venture Projects
![My profile in the webpage where I ad myself](https://github.com/rescolarandres/Coding_venture_projects/blob/main/clases.png "Image Title")

In here, the most especial out of the ~100 projects I have developed as freelance coder are shared. Most of them are related to Master's/Bachelor Thesis/Assigments in which I helped students solve their codes. This type of projects help me learn and implement coding solutions to an broad range of fields, varying from telco engineering to power forecasting models or banking offices optimization.
